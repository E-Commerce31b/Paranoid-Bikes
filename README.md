Hello and welcome to the incredible world of Paranoid Bikes! 

Our company was founded with the goal of providing quick and easy acces to bicycles for people. Currently, bikes are used as either a means of transportation or
for recreation. The popularity of cycling has risen for several reasons, such as its benefits for healt, sustaniability, convenience, and cost-effectiveness. <br>

Paranoid-bikes is an S.P.A. build with React.js in front-end, and Node.js in back-end, as well as MongoDB for database. It uses "99spokes" API for collecting bikes
